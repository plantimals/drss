<p>The annual premier hackathon event for the North American Ethereum community, ETHDenver and ColoradoJam, has come to a close. The 2021 event was 100% virtual, utilizing the gaming platform Gamerjibe as a virtual event venue, creating a unique and refreshing way for the dweb community to gather together.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="event-highlights">Event highlights</h2>

<p>When it came to building with IPFS, we saw NFT marketplaces, decentralized and off-chain gaming, platforms solving real world issues involving life insurance and genetic testing, and consistently created ways to lower barriers for wallet creation, token creation, and more.
 * 31 out 86 total projects submitted to ETHDenver applied for IPFS bounties
 * 64 out of 86 projects submitted applied for IPFS-ecosystem tooling bounties (the most popular being Ceramic, Textile and Metamask)
 * The IPFS project awarded bounties to 11 submissions for their creative use of IPFS
 * 32 of the 51 winning projects were award bounties for using IPFS-ecosystem tooling</p>

<p>See all of the <a href="https://ethdenver2021.devfolio.co/submissions">ETHDenver submissions here</a> and read <a href="https://medium.com/ethdenver/ethdenver-coloradojam-2021-bounty-track-quadratic-funding-winners-805cf5f2de76">about the winners</a>, too!</p>

<p>Alongside the event Discord, the livestream, and the hacks, ETHDenver also created a virtual venue for attendees to wander around, try on swag, gather collectibles, check out sponsor booths, and hang out as a community.</p>

<p>In lieu of a sponsor booth, the IPFS Help Desk returned! Folks from IPFS, Slate, Fleek, Pinata, Opera, and Foundation all took turns hosting as their digital avatars, even occasionally running into a rainbow Pegabufficorn.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-new-in-go-ipfs-0-8-0">What&rsquo;s new in go-ipfs 0.8.0?</h2>

<p>This release is focused on making it easier to work with pins! We have some snazzy new features around being able to ask remote services to pin data for you, and modifying large pin sets is much faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">üî¶ Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="remote-pinning-services">üß∑ Remote pinning services</h3>

<p>There is now support for asking remote services to pin data for you.</p>

<p>This feature is a redesign of how we&rsquo;re thinking about pinning and includes some commonly requested features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pins can have names (and coming soon metadata)</li>
<li>Data can be pinned in either the foreground or background</li>
<li>Pins can be searched for by name, CID, or status</li>
</ul>

<p>Command-line users benefit from <code>ipfs pin remote</code> commands, simplifying remote pinning operations. The built-in pinning service API client also executes all necessary remote calls under the hood:</p>

<p><img style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="/125-go-ipfs-0-8-0/125-go-ipfs-0-8-0-diagram.png" alt="go-ipfs 0.8.0" /></p>

<p>As long as a pinning service supports the vendor-agnostic <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/">IPFS Pinning Service API</a>, it can be used directly in go-ipfs. (If you&rsquo;re a Pinata user, you can already <a href="https://pinata.cloud/documentation#PinningServicesAPI">check out their docs</a> for how to set everything up.)</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ipfs pin remote service add mysrv https://my-service.example.com/api-endpoint myAccessToken
ipfs pin remote service ls --stat # confirm service mysrv is available
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ipfs pin remote add /ipfs/bafymydata --service=mysrv --name=myfile  # will block until status is pinned
ipfs pin remote ls --service=mysrv --name=myfile
ipfs pin remote rm --service=mysrv --name=myfile
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-sh">ipfs pin remote add /ipfs/bafymydata2 --service=mysrv --name=myfile2 --background  # queue pin request and finish instantly
ipfs pin remote ls --service=mysrv --cid=bafymydata2 --status=queued,pinning,pinned,failed
ipfs pin remote rm --service=mysrv --cid=bafymydata2 --status=queued,pinning,pinned,failed
</code></pre>

<p>More examples can be found under <code>ipfs pin remote --help</code>.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote pinning services work with recursive pins. This means commands like <code>ipfs pin remote ls</code> will not list indirectly pinned CIDs.</li>
<li>By default, only finished, successful pins are listed. To list or remove pending/failed pins, pass explicit statuses: e.g. <code>--status=queued,pinning,pinned,failed</code></li>
<li>While pinning service data is stored in the configuration file it cannot be edited directly via the <code>ipfs config</code> commands due to the sensitive nature of pinning service API keys. The <code>ipfs pin remote service</code> commands can be used for interacting with remote service settings.</li>
<li>An OpenAPI <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec/blob/main/ipfs-pinning-service.yaml">ipfs-pinning-service.yaml</a> makes it easy to create or <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec#code-generation">generate</a> a compatible client/server. Anyone can implement it and allow for pin management.</li>
<li>Additionally, HTTP API users now have access to new commands under <code>/api/v0/pin/remote</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remote-mfs-pinning-policy">üè† Remote MFS pinning policy</h2>

<p>Every service added via <code>ipfs pin remote service add</code> can be tasked to update a pin every time the MFS root changes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ipfs config --json Pinning.RemoteServices.mysrv.Policies.MFS.Enable
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid flooding the remote service with many updates, go-ipfs will send updates at most once every five minutes.
Details about customizing behavior of this feature can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#pinningremoteservices-policiesmfs">configuration docs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="faster-local-pinning-and-unpinning">üìå Faster local pinning and unpinning</h3>

<p>The pinning subsystem has been redesigned to be much faster and more flexible in how it tracks pins. For users who are working with many pins this will lead to a big speed increase in listing and modifying the set of pinned items as well as decreased memory usage.</p>

<p>Part of the redesign was set up to account for being able to interact with local pins the same way we can now interact with remote pins (e.g. names, being allowed to pin the same CID multiple times, etc.). Keep posted for more improvements to pinning.</p>

<h3 id="dnslink-names-on-https-subdomains">üîí DNSLink names on https:// subdomains</h3>

<p>Previously, DNSLink names would have trouble loading over subdomain gateways with HTTPS support since there is no way to get multi-level wildcard certificates (e.g. <code>en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org.ipns.dweb.link</code> cannot be covered by <code>*.ipns.dweb.link</code>). Therefore, when trying to load DNSLink names over https:// subdomains in go-ipfs, we now forward to an encoded DNS name. Since DNS names cannot contain <code>.</code> in them they are escaped using <code>-</code>.</p>

<p><code>/ipns/en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org</code> ‚Üí</p>

<p><code>ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org</code> ‚Üí</p>

<p><code>https://dweb.link/ipns/en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org</code> ‚Üí</p>

<p><code>https://en-wikipedia--on--ipfs-org.ipns.dweb.link</code> üëà a single DNS label, no TLS error</p>

<p>Note: The last redirect is specific to HTTPS, and is triggered only when <code>X-Forwarded-Proto: https</code> header is present.<br />
Recipes for setting up your own public gateway can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md#gateway-recipes">configuration docs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="quic-update">üí® QUIC update</h3>

<p>QUIC support has received a number of upgrades, including the ability to take advantage of larger UDP receive buffers for increased performance.</p>

<p>Linux users may notice a logged error on daemon startup if your system needs extra configuration to allow IPFS to increase the buffer size. A helpful link for resolving this is in the log message as well as <a href="https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/wiki/UDP-Receive-Buffer-Size">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="no-more-darwin-386-builds">üëã No more Darwin 386 builds</h3>

<p>Go 1.15 (the latest version of Go) <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34749">no longer supports</a> Darwin 386 and so we are dropping support as well.</p>

<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>

<p>For a full list of updates included in this release, you can review the changelog within this <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.8.0">release post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming soon &hellip;</h3>

      <description>The ProtoSchool team is pleased to announce the launch of a shiny new multiple-choice tutorial introducing libp2p, the modular peer-to-peer networking stack that spun out of IPFS into its own first-class project and a dependency of IPFS itself.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The <a href="https://proto.school">ProtoSchool</a> team is pleased to announce the launch of a shiny new multiple-choice tutorial <a href="https://proto.school/introduction-to-libp2p">introducing libp2p</a>, the modular peer-to-peer networking stack that spun out of IPFS into its own first-class project and a dependency of IPFS itself. Today, IPFS focuses on <em>content addressing</em> (i.e., finding, fetching and authenticating any piece of content in the web) while libp2p focuses on <em>process addressing</em> (i.e., finding, connecting and authenticating any data transfer processes in the network).</p>

<p><img style="width: 42rem" src="/124-libp2p-comes-to-protoschool/libp2p-ipfs-animation.gif" alt="libp2p animation representing libp2p being extracted out of ipfs" /></p>

<p>Historically, companies that produced peer-to-peer applications like Skype or BitTorrent created their own protocols to support them. Those protocols made a lot of assumptions about the environments they‚Äôd run in and the needs they‚Äôd meet, making them incredibly hard to upgrade or adapt to new environments. libp2p, however, has been extracted from its original implementation as the networking stack of IPFS, and can now serve a broad variety of use cases. While everyone building on IPFS or Filecoin is using libp2p as a dependency, many folks are using libp2p independently or embedded in other projects such as Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Status.im.</p>

<p><img style="width: 50rem" src="/124-libp2p-comes-to-protoschool/libp2p-logo-animation.gif" alt="libp2p animation representing libp2p modularity. Each block of the libp2p logo represents a component of the libp2p network stack." /></p>

<p>libp2p takes a modular approach to addressing the many components that can make up a network stack, from transports to multiplexing and beyond. A user can choose the specific pieces they need and compose their own configuration, tailored for their use cases. All of those pieces have very well defined interfaces that enable interoperability and easy upgrades, creating a future-proof networking stack. This ecosystem of interoperable modules is key to libp2p‚Äôs versatility across multiple environments.</p>

<p>Learn more in our code-free <a href="https://proto.school/introduction-to-libp2p">Introduction to libp2p tutorial</a>, or view our full <a href="https://proto.school/course/ipfs">IPFS course on ProtoSchool</a> for intros to fundamental DWeb concepts, hands-on coding challenges with the js-ipfs APIs, and more.</p>

<h2 id="more-on-libp2p">More on libp2p</h2>

<p>We‚Äôre excited to bring more libp2p content to ProtoSchool in the near future! In the meantime, we highly recommend the <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/">libp2p docs site</a> as a great source of conceptual explainers, as well as code examples featuring the Go Lang, JavaScript, and Rust implementations of the networking stack.</p>

<h2 id="help-us-improve-protoschool">Help us improve ProtoSchool</h2>

<p>ProtoSchool is a team effort, and we depend on folks in the IPFS and dweb community to outline new content, add new features, fix bugs, catch typos, and test-drive new tutorials like this one. There are many ways to <a href="https://proto.school/contribute">contribute to the project</a>, no matter your background, and our new multiple-choice format makes it super easy to <a href="https://proto.school/build">create new tutorials</a> without any coding experience. In fact, the awesome Jos√© Bateira, who created our latest tutorial, built it with the help of our user-friendly ProtoWizard CLI!</p>

<p><img src="/115-protoschool-merkle-dags/protowizard.png" alt="Screenshot of ProtoWizard CLI"/></p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to help is by sharing your feedback as you explore our tutorials. You‚Äôll find a link at the bottom of every lesson to help you submit your suggestions.</p>

</p>

<p>In 2020 we announced a big moment for IPFS: The first official support of IPFS protocol addressing in a major browser, when <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-30-ipfs-in-opera-for-android/">Opera released IPFS support in their Android browser</a>. This was an important step in IPFS browser support generally, by building interest and momentum. We didn‚Äôt stop there, and we‚Äôve got not just one‚Ä¶ BUT TWO releases to share with you today!</p>

<p>First, Opera has now added support for IPFS addressing to Opera Touch, their iOS browser.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/img/opera-ios-wikipedia-short.png" alt="A screenshot of Wikipedia on IPFS in Opera Touch">
</p>

<p>Second, support for IPFS addressing in Opera desktop browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux will be coming in their next release, currently planned for March 2021.</p>

<p>As a special surprise for EthDenver, you can download a preview build of Opera for desktop which has IPFS addressing support! Give it a spin at <a href="https://ethdenver2021.opera.com">ethdenver2021.opera.com</a>.</p>

<p>With these releases, Opera will now support <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> addressing across their browser product line on all major operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>First, install Opera Touch on your iOS device. If you‚Äôre reading this on an iOS device, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opera-touch-web-browser/id1411869974">click to install now</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/img/opera-ios-app-store-short.png" alt="Opera Touch in the iOS app store">
</p>

<p>Then you can open content using IPFS protocol addresses, like the <a href="ipns://blog.ipfs.io">blog you‚Äôre reading now</a>, <a href="ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org">Wikipedia</a>, or this <a href="ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi">Persian room guardian</a> by <a href="https://www.anyabozartist.com/the-persian-cat">Anya Boz</a>. You can easily upload files to IPFS using the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-desktop/">IPFS desktop application</a> or <a href="https://share.ipfs.io">Share.ipfs.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Opera Touch supports navigating to addresses for <code>ipfs://</code> and <code>ipns://</code> protocol schemes, which are handled by a remote HTTP gateway. By default the gateway used is <code>dweb.link</code>, which is operated by Protocol Labs. The ability to select a different gateway is coming in the next update of Opera Touch.</p>

<p>Native representation of IPFS addresses in browsers is important, even when the content is loaded from an HTTP gateway as IPFS URIs are resolved out of the box, without the need for any additional extensions or opt-in settings, which familiarizes users and developers with decentralized concepts of content-addressing and creates a path to readiness for when native nodes are available.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2>

<p>Opera desktop browser support for IPFS addressing will ship soon, and we‚Äôre discussing what additional features to add next to build on top of this foundation of universal addressing support across the Opera browser line. Have ideas for what you‚Äôd like to see in Opera next? Let us know on the <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.io/">IPFS forums</a>, or tweet your ideas to <a href="https://twitter.com/opera">@Opera</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ipfs">@IPFS</a> on Twitter!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NAT UPnP Hole Punching</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>js-IPFS@0.54.0</code> enables NAT traversal with UPnP enabled routers for improved connectivity, but also requires a repo upgrade in the browser</p>

<h2 id="nat-upnp-hole-punching">‚ÜîÔ∏è NAT UPnP Hole Punching</h2>

<p>When you run an IPFS node on your home network you are commonly behind a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> firewall. These types of firewalls are commonly used on home networks to work around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">shortage of IPv4 addresses</a> in the world.</p>

<p>Normally, it‚Äôs not possible for computers external to your network to make connections to your node when this sort of infrastructure is between you and the remote computer. It‚Äôs essential for external computers to be able to connect to your computer when using IPFS, otherwise there is no way for remote nodes to fetch content stored on your node.</p>

<p>This problem is not unique to IPFS, it also extends to any P2P network and a lot of online games. Thankfully there is a solution: if your router supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a> and you have it enabled, a process on your computer can communicate with the router and ask it to open an external port and forward all traffic sent to that port to your machine. Once the port has been opened, we are then free to inform our connected peers that they can open connections on this external port as and when required via the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify">libp2p identify protocol</a>.</p>

<p>js-IPFS@0.54.0 enables UPnP NAT hole punching by default, but it will only work if UPnP is enabled on your router; instructions for enabling this will vary by manufacturer so please see your router‚Äôs documentation for more information on how to enable.</p>

<p>If everything works as expected, you should start to see externally addressable multiaddrs in the output of <code>jsipfs id</code> a short time after daemon startup without any extra configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">$ jsipfs id
{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;QmT2aN...&quot;,
  &quot;publicKey&quot;: &quot;CAASpgIwggEiMA0...&quot;,
  &quot;addresses&quot;: [
    &quot;/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4002/p2p/QmT2aN...&quot;,
    &quot;/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4003/ws/p2p/QmT2aN...&quot;,
    &quot;/ip4/192.168.2.50/tcp/4002/p2p/QmT2aN...&quot;,
    &quot;/ip4/81.132.237.123/tcp/55170/p2p/QmT2aN...&quot;  // &lt;-- externally addressable!
  ],
  // ...other fields here
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not wish to enable hole punching, you can set the <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md#disablenatportmap">Swarm.DisableNatPortMap</a> config key to <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">$ jsipfs config --json Swarm.DisableNatPortMap true
</code></pre>

<h2 id="level-js-upgrade">level-js upgrade</h2>

<p><code>js-IPFS@0.54.0</code> uses the latest version of level-js in the browser. <code>level-js@4.x.x</code> and below support storing keys as either <code>string</code>s or <code>Uint8Array</code>s, but <code>level-js@5.x.x</code> only supports Uint8Arrays in line with <code>leveldown</code> on Node.js.</p>

<p>This means a database migration will be necessary for those running js-IPFS in the browser (Node.js is unaffected).</p>

<p>This migration should take place automatically the first time you load <code>js-IPFS@0.54.0</code> on a web page that has previously used <code>js-IPFS@0.53.0</code> and below.</p>

<p>You can disable this feature by passing <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/blob/master/docs/MODULE.md#optionsrepoautomigrate"><code>repoAutoMigrate: false</code></a> to the IPFS constructor:</p>

<pre><code class="language-js">const node = await IPFS.create({
  repoAutoMigrate: false
})
</code></pre>

<p>Though if you do this, you should give your users some way of upgrading because <code>level-js@5.x.x</code> cannot see any database keys that are not <code>Uint8Array</code>s.</p>
