# drss - distributed really simple syndication

RSS is a channel of distribution where content producers retail some control of their content, and consumers get the ordered feed that they prefer. 

## walled gardens

concerns over internet centralization have been present since before it was released to the public. some of those concerns proved to be hyperbolic, some have been prophetic. AOL was once criticized as a "walled garden", where its users were stunted in their ability to find and curate useful content. Facebook is as much a walled garden as AOL ever was. the problem with walled gardens is intellectual weakness it breeds. rather than concerning themselves with the sources of information, looking for credibility, expertise, and vetting, the masses would rather seek an arrangement where this work is outsourced to the supplier. this leads to centralization of information flows, and rather than catering to the expansive array of different perspectives and interests, costs and uncertainty can be managed by causing people to want the same thing. in most cases the people enacting these strategies are not bad people, but the incentives of such systems inevitably lead to bad outcomes. 

so rather than bemoan this state of affairs further, let us build something with the right incentives in its place.

distributed rss is meant to work alongside of current RSS, by ingesting existing rss feeds and publishing them to IPLD
